css selectors

.class
#id
* apply for all
element
element, elem (both will be selected)
element elem (elem inside element will be selected)
element > elem (elem with element parent will be selected)
element + elem (all elem next to element will be selected)
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)


What selectors win out in the cascade depends on:
-specificity
-importance
-source order

A selector's specificity is calculated as follows:
count the number of ID selectors in the selector (= a)
count the number of class selectors, attributes selectors, and pseudo-classes in the selector (= b)
count the number of type selectors and pseudo-elements in the selector (= c)
ignore the universal selector
